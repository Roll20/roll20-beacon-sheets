- Implement fighting stance stats (attack needed for attack roll, potential needed for parry roll in defensive)

- Add drag and drop functionality for all item categories
    -> Rollable:     discipline, weapon, armor, equipment, spells
    -> Show in chat: torment, rout, advantage, disadvantage, premise, awakening, rise, ascension
    -> Ensure all sections have the item(s) displayed properly

- Discipline bonus + penalty cannot be filled, inherits from domain.

- Armor and Weapons ALWAYS need a domain set

- Add all remaining rolls
    -> Parry:      1d10 + @combativeness + @domainScore + @stanceModifier - @healthModifier
    -> Weapon:     1d10 + @combativeness + @domain/disciplineScore + @stanceModifier - @healthModifier
    -> Armor?
    -> Spell:      1d10 + Spell Discipline + Associated Way - @healthModifier
    -> Discipline: 1d10 + @base + @bonus + @way - @penalty - @healthModifier\

- Ensure sheet opens at requested size (doesn't work in sandbox?)
