# Beacon Example Sheet

## Getting Started
These are a list of commands to help you run your first sheet and get you started.

We recommend installing dependencies and being able to run your project from our example sheet template before diving into development.

### Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### Run the vite server for sandbox development
This will allow you to set your sandbox port in a sandbox game or using the advanced settings for a character sheet in Roll20 Characters. That way you can test out your sheet live as you make development changes.
```sh
npm run sandbox
```

### Hot reload and build css for roll templates
```sh
npm run watch-scss
```

### Eslint Files
```sh
npm run lint
```

### Format with prettier
```sh
npm run format
```

### Type Check with typescript
```sh
npm run type-check
```

### Unit Test with Vitest
```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Local End To End Tests with Cypress
```sh
npm run test:e2e:local
```

### CDN Hosted End To End Tests with Cypress
```sh
npm run test:e2e
```
