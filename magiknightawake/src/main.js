/*
Welcome to the Magi-Knights Awakening sheet!

If you are new to vue, this is the file that will render the vue app. This vue app is a quickstart guide,
to help get you started and familiar with the new flow of sheet development with our beacon SDK.

This vue app features one component, App.vue, that renders the entire sheet.

There is one custom data store, stores/sheetStore.js, to help detail how you can add what you need for your sheet.
Also, you can leverage character data already provided for you through the meta data store which is already setup for you in App.vue

The ability to read and write changes to your data is already configured with the beacon relay and you don't have to do any work to set that up.

This quickstart also features an example of how to render a roll template with the new beacon sheets. The roll templates still leverage handlebars with custom css,
and you can find that example being used in App.vue by sending a trait to the chat.
