## Quickstart Sheet with Vue

If you are not familiar with Vue.js, this is the starting point for you!

This project features:
* No Typescript
* No Unit Tests nor the ability to run them
* No End to End tests nor the ability to run them
* A single data store for your specific sheet data
* A single roll template

Copy the `quickstart-example-sheet` directory and rename the directory with a **name** that resembles the sheet you are wanting to make. Make sure to update the package.json name to your desired sheet name.
