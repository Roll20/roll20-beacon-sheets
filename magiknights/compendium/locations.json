      "Frost Peak Academy Faculty": "<p>Frost Peak Academy Faculty</p>\n<h3>Dr. Alice Walker (Principal)</h3>\nAn extremely beautiful and refined woman in her late 30s. Many students consider her detached and calculating, running the academy with the efficiency of a production line. She is a logical thinker and extremely stubborn once she has come to a conclusion. Works closely with Chancellor Otomo of Blackmote University and fast-tracks her best students to the prestigious college. Maintains that students learn best in a sterile, clean environment; her office always smells of bleach and rubbing alcohol. Holds a doctorate in Psychology from Blackmote University.\n<h3>Mr. Johnny Davenroy (English Teacher)</h3>\nOnly in his second year of teaching and in his mid-20s, Mr. Davenroy is the most laid back of the teachers, though cunning and irresistibly charming. Frequently relies on these skills to escape fallout from Principal Walker, who loathes his methods but cannot deny his students' testing results. Likely the most friendly and relatable teacher, easily balancing \"mentor and confidant\" with many students. Has a smoking problem he tries to keep under wraps.\n<h3>Ms. Christina Accord (History Teacher)</h3>\nAn attractive and intelligent woman in her 30s who has earned the nickname \"The Terror of Frost Peak\" for being incredibly short-tempered and intimidating. However, insightful students have caught on that this demeanor is a facade to make trouble-making students transfer out early. After the first month, she becomes more calm and approachable, though her high standards never lower. Loves wearing all black on testing days and teasing about \"Hell Week.\"\n<h3>Mr. Samuel Toussaint (Mathematics Teacher)</h3>\nA stern and authoritative Haitian man in his early 40s. Standing at 6'4\" and 220 lbs, with a hard-cut jawline from years in the military as a Training Sergeant. Expects nothing but the best and gives additional homework when class is not on-task. However, his worst-kept secret is his obsession with bubbles and plotting their circumference - a passion shared with Mr. MacMillian at Math Club.\n<h3>Prof. Maxwell MacMillian (Science Teacher)</h3>\nAn elderly gentleman and scholar in his mid-70s whose mind remains sharp as ever. Pleasant and reserved, he was formerly Head Professor of Mathematics at Blackmote University. None know why he left such a prestigious position. Quiet-spoken and easy to get along with, often saying \"Though very young, you are all truly my equals.\" However, only the brightest students understand his explanations. Extremely patient and willing to assign additional homework for \"exercising the little gray cells.\"\n<h3>Mr. Benjamin Becks (Fine Art / Music Teacher)</h3>\nAn excitable and eccentric adult in his early 20s who turned down an offer from a prestigious worldwide symphony to teach. Always has a smile and enthusiastic disposition, especially during music classes. Has learned an extremely wide variety of instruments with incredible skill. Very tall and skinny but well respected by musically-oriented students. Others may describe him as \"overly energetic and cumbersomely cheerful.\"\n<h3>Mr. Edgar Howard Applewood (Technology Teacher)</h3>\n\"Mr. H\" is an eccentric and strange but handsome man with sharp features in his early 30s. Prefers the company of computers to people and often communicates worldwide with technology enthusiasts. Detached and methodical as a teacher, rarely showing emotion but prone to occasional bouts of excitable mania. Primarily dresses in black and subdued colors. When he chooses to speak, even Principal Walker takes his suggestions into careful consideration.\n<h3>Ms. Zerenity Luminitza (Foreign Languages / Home Economics)</h3>\nA well-educated and quiet woman in her early 30s. Was a foreign woman living abroad as manager of a small but successful traveling business until it was bought out. A renowned polyglot who fluently speaks nine languages with a master's degree in Linguistics. Demure and intelligent with few local friends, has a slight accent from her home country. Typically found enjoying literature at the local library. Has a keen but secret interest in the occult, divination, and esoteric knowledge.\n<h3>Ms. Faith Solitario (P.E. / Health / Coach)</h3>\nThe only child of an immigrant family, Faith is a very attractive and physically fit woman in her late 20s. Her dreams of winning the first world cup for her national women's sports team were dashed by an unfortunate accident. Coped by throwing herself into teaching and assistant coaching with unmatched ferocity. At best, a no-nonsense, passionate woman who pushes students to their limits; at worst, hot-headed and arrogant. Replaced Coach Mark Bobanova after his sudden disappearance. Led the girl's basketball and boy's soccer teams to state victories.\n<h3>Ms. Sally La'Fleur (Art / Drama / Jewelry)</h3>\nAn excitable, overworked lady in her late 30s powered solely by obscene amounts of coffee. Works at school while also owning Witch's Wardrobe costume shop. Her demeanor is a roller coaster from energetic and fast-talking to slumped and dismissive, dictated by her last cup of coffee. Has wild red hair, wide-circular glasses, and typically wears sweaters and long skirts. Her art taste is eclectic, focusing on obscure old painters and the backgrounds of artwork rather than focal areas.\n<h3>Ms. Aria Tovey (School Counselor)</h3>\nIn her mid-20s and the newest addition to Frost Peak faculty. Has an eager desire to prove herself. Very little is known about her beyond her cheery disposition. Most who interact with her feel she is a beacon of sunshine and comfort where stress runs high. Her young, bubbly attitude can breathe new life into even the most despondent students, and her unique giggle is both adorable and infectious."
